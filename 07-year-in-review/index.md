School

School has been a wild ride this year. Although i do not enjoy school at all, it gives me something to do and keeps me on my feet. My grades and attendance werent all that great, but Im somehow managing to always get through at the end. Because of my ADHD, its hard for me to get myself to do things on time, but on the other side I developed myself to work well under pressure.

Internship

I have been blessed with being able to have my internship at PKproject cars, which is my friends dads company. I really love fast cool cars, so this has been like a dream for me. Ive had the opportunity to sit and sometimes even drive some of my dream cars. Ive done videos, photos and designs for their social media and website. 

Personal

This past year has been very challenging, but also super fun aswell. I got to meet some of my favorite artists of all time, made new friends, got a new job after 8 years and started to train Muay thai, which has been the best decision Ive made in a long time. I feel very fit, and am finally doing something I wanted to do as kid, so im slowly starting to make my dreams come true one small step at a time.

Free time

In my free time I spent a lot of it with my friends. Either going out, doing some fun stuff or just playing games on discord. Ive been reflecting on how to better myself and am trying to become the best version of myself. I still have a very long way to go, but I think and hope Im on the right path!
