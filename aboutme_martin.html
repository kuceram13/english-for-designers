<h1>Hello, my name is Martin</h1>
	
	<p>Hello, my name is Martin and im an digital artist.

I specialize in cover arts and merch/clothing design.

In my spare time I love to do Thaibox, skate and spend time with my friends and family.

My digital art journey started when I was about 12 years old and wanted to become a youtuber just like anybody else that age at that time. I wanted my channel to look just as cool as the biggest youtubers, but when I found out how much it cost I decided to learn how to do it on my own. And when I was 15, I decided study Graphic design and Animation.

My goal with digital art is to work with my favorite music Artists and create my own succesful clothing brand.</p>
