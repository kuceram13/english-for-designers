Tone of Voice

Voice

my voice is naturally really loud and kind of raspy, which means its not hard for me to catch attention. I usually speak clear, with good articulation so everybody can understand me.

Tone

My voice isn't very deep, so it already sounds friendly, but i try to sound as friendly and passive as possible. I try to speak calmly, but sometimes when my emotions get overwhelming I cant control it and speak very loud without realizing it. 

Style

I try to come off as friendly and approachable as I can, even though I dont really like being approached. Sometimes I struggle with nervousness, so I stutter, mix words, or say completely different words. I wouldnt say im the best speaker in the world, but im definitely not the worst one.
